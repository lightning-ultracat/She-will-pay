### If you've read warrior cats, you will understand this better. If not, that's fine, it's still logic.

         "Let all cats old enough to catch their own prey join here beneath Call-Rock for a clan meeting!"
             I opened my eyes. Sunlight filtered through the gaps in the Apprentices' den. I pawed my sister, SnowyPaw, softly. "Wake up, Sleepyhead," I said quietly in her ear. "It's time for a clan meeting." SnowyPaw grumbled, but got up. "I heard it, stupid. I was awake the whole time!" With that, she marched out of the den, her tail high in the air. I sighed. Does SnowyPaw have something against me? It sure seems so, i thought.
   
   
   The sun was even brighter outside. I narrowed my eyes against it. "Does it really have to be this bright?" i muttered to myself. "The sun has been like this for a while now. But i guess it is, after all, my first summer since i was a newborn kit."
         SnowyPaw came up to me. "What's wrong, Scaredy-mouse? Come out of the den. your stupid best friend, NightPaw, is waiting." She taunted. "Hey! Don't call NightPaw that! It's rude. And you have no friends, anyway. So why do you even care?"
           Once we were all positioned in front of MoonStar, the meeting began. "FennecKit, step forward." FennecKit righted with surprise. He stepped up nervously, his head down. "I-I'm sorry, MoonStar! I didn't mean to push BlossomKit into the wall of the Warriors' den yesterday!" Oh FennecKit, Didn't he know how old he was? It was time for him to become an apprentice! Silly FennecKit, i thought.
       
       
       "Do you promise to defend your clan, even with your life?"
     "yes."
"Then, i hearby proclaim that this young warrior will be known as FennecPaw, until he is skilled enough to become a warrior of our clan," she meowed. "FlowerEye, you will mentor FennecPaw. I trust you to pass down the skills you have learned to him."
"FennecPaw! FennecPaw! FennecPaw!''
            As we cheered, i thought about NightPaw. He had been made an apprentice only a quarter moon before i had, so we where close enough in age to act the same way, fight the same way, and have similar interests. Because SnowyPaw and I were not particularly close, NightPaw and i where as close as two hairs on a fox's pelt. He was always there for me, and i was always there for him. Most of the clan treated us like brother and sister. They would say things like, "I will send out a hunting patrol with NightPaw, SunsetSpirit, and me. AuraPaw, i assume you want to come too?" and, "AuraPaw, help me with this Bramble. It doesn't want to fit for some reason. I know you're probably going to ask, NightPaw, so you can help too." Stuff like that. We are best friends.
              As the meeting ended, the deputy, MelodyShadow, came up to NightPaw and me. "I would like you two to go on a border patrol with FennecPaw and SnowyPaw. Oh, and SunsetSpirit will accompany you to make sure you stay safe and don't get into trouble." He mewed. "Leave as soon as you can, EmberClan has been known to cross the border lately, as  you know."
                                                                  * * * *
       Me and NightPaw padded along softly, talking about EmberClan. We were do to go into battle with then any day now. "So when do you think they will attack?" I mewed. "Well, for all we know, they could be attacking now." NightPaw responded. "I don't think so, we would have scented them. We are walking along their border, after all. They wouldn't cross CloudClan territory, would they?" I remarked. "Probably. EmberClan is too smart to take a longer route. They would go straight to NightClan." He joked. "Yeah, they don't want to waste even two paw steps out of line!" I joked back.
            "come look, you two, we've caught scent of a mouse nest." SunsetSpirit said nicely. "Good, but how can we catch them?" I mewed. "I'll show you!" NightPaw mewed exitedly. "Ok, everyone, calm down. The mice will run away if we get any louder!" SunsetSpirit meowed over everyone. "Ok, AuraPaw, pick a spot. Together, we will surround the nest." NightPaw whispered in my ear. I surrounded it, rather joyfully. "Now, I will attack the nest. You four, be ready to catch any that escape. The rest, I'll get."
       
       
       NightPaw raced after an old mouse. I turned my head back just in time to capture a young one that squealed quite a bit. I gave it a swift killing bite, Then looked around to see SunsetSpirit with three mice in her jaws. "Wow!" i exclaimed. "You're good at this!" SunsetSpirit nodded, her mouth full. FennecPaw raced up to me. "I caught one! I caught one! I caught one!" he chanted. "Well done! I remember how happy i was when i caught my first prey." I purred. "It must feel great!"
           
           
           Where was SnowyPaw and NightPaw? "Do you know where SnowyPaw and NightPaw went?" I asked SunsetSpirit. "No," she responded, "Can you go look for them? I'm sure you know NightPaw's scent the best." she added. "Ok! meet you back at camp." I mewed.
      
      
      I followed NightPaw's scent. A few moments' time later, SnowyPaw's scent joined in. "Why would SnowPaw want to follow him?" I asked myself. Their scents were quite strong now. Fresh. Then I saw it. NightPaw was dead. Blood all over his pelt. SnowyPaw's scent was everywhere.
         "What has she done?" I wailed. "No! No, no no, nooooo!" I couldn't believe this. My own sister killed my best friend. "NightPaw! Come back! Come back to me!" It was no use. My friend was gone. Gone forever. I might never see him again. It was all my own sisters' fault.


 She will pay for what she has done.
  she will pay.
